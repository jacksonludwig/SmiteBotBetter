# SmiteBotBetter

## Description
This discord bot will retrieve a smite build from a MySQL database. It gives core items, as well as offensive and defensive options.

## Use
Simply say "#build" followed by a god name, such as "#build anubis". Multi-world god names should be put in quotes or have dashes in between, e.g. "ah puch" or nu-wa.
